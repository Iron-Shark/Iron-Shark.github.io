If you're about my age and had a similarly dull upbringing, you probably also
have memories of playing video games behind a teacher's back whenever class
involved going to some sort of "computer lab." Flash games were the thing when I
was in elementary school, and when I was in middle school, I'd bring Quake with
me on a flash drive. By the time I was in high school, I'd realized that these
opportunities were better spent getting a head start on homework for other
classes, but I did have a few friends who still passed the time playing video
games. Rather than Flash games or Quake, though, these were browser games using
the new-fangled HTML5 canvas. I'd practically forgotten these games existed
until someone from my capture-the-flag team mentioned "krunker.io". [[http://iogames.space/][Apparently]]
it's one of the more popular ones. It got me thinking about how I'd go about
writing cheats for a game in the browser. Writing cheats for CS:GO was a breeze,
so why would this be any harder? I had some time to spare over winter break, so
I decided to give it a go and see what kind of damage I could do.

* Reconnaissance

[[https://mitmproxy.org/][mitmproxy]] was pretty much the only tool I used in this project. The first thing
I did was hook my browser up to it and load the game to see what kinds of
requests it made.[fn:1]

[[./mitmproxy-initial.png]]

I've truncated it here because the flows that came afterwards were just assets.
Right off the bat, we're learning quite a bit about the game's infrastructure.
Namely that it has three parts:

1. 'krunker.io', the URL you type into your browser, which is where the code is.
2. 'assets.krunker.io', for serving up textures and models.
3. 'matchmaker.krunker.io', which appears to be some sort of REST API for
   finding a game.

I'm sure that reversing the Matchmaking API would be fun, but there's more fun
to be had in messing with the code.

** Code

We can see from the flow that the following libraries are loaded:

- 'jquery-3.2.1.min.js'
- 'jquery-ui.js'
- 'howler.min.js'
- 'Tween.min.js'
- 'nipplejs.min.js'
- 'zip.js'
- 'zip-ext.js'

We all know what jQuery is. After consulting the all-mighty search engine of the
interwebs, I figured out that [[https://howlerjs.com/][howler.js]] is an audio library, that [[https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js/][tween.js]] is a
library for animations, and that [[https://yoannmoi.net/nipplejs/][nippleJS]] is a virtual joystick for mobile
devices.[fn:2] I was tripped up by 'zip.js' and 'zip-ext.js' initially, thinking
that these are where the code is, but it didn't take long to realize that these
constitute the [[https://gildas-lormeau.github.io/zip.js/][zip.js]] library for working with ZIP files. Well, if the game code
isn't in any of those files, then it has to be inlined in a =<script>= tag
somewhere. A quick =grep= reveals that it is, indeed, at the bottom of the page.

* Injecting Code

This is where one of the more interesting features of mitmproxy comes in. I
split the page's HTML into three files: one containing everything leading up to
the script, one containing the script itself, and one containing everything that
follows the script. Then, I whipped up a quick [[https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/addons-overview/][addon]] for piecing those together
on the fly when we see a request for 'krunker.io'.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from mitmproxy import ctx

class Replacer:
    def __init__(self):
        with open("header.html") as f:
            self.header = f.read()
        with open("game.js") as f:
            self.game = f.read()
        with open("footer.html") as f:
            self.footer = f.read()

    def response(self, flow):
        if flow.request.host == "krunker.io" and flow.request.path == "/":
            flow.response.set_text(self.header + self.game + self.footer)

addons = [
    Replacer()
]
#+END_SRC

With an environment set up for experimenting, it was time to get into it. I ran
[[https://beautifier.io/][beautifier.io]] on 'game.js' and began to peer around for strings of note. There's
a massive base64 blob in the middle of the file that stood out like a sore
thumb, so I decoded it to see what it was.

#+BEGIN_SRC prog
jakob@Epsilon ~ $ base64 -d < /tmp/extracted.b64 | file -
/dev/stdin: WebAssembly (wasm) binary module version 0x1 (MVP)
#+END_SRC

Whoa, holy shit! This is the first time I'm seeing WebAssembly in the wild!

Thinking I'd want to modify the blob, I extracted it to a file and modified the
addon slightly.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from base64 import b64encode

from mitmproxy import ctx

class Replacer:
    def __init__(self):
        with open("header.html") as f:
            self.header = f.read()
        with open("game.js") as f, open("krunker.wasm", "rb") as g:
            self.game = f.read().replace("[REPLACE ME]", b64encode(g.read()).decode())
        with open("footer.html") as f:
            self.footer = f.read()

    def response(self, flow):
        if flow.request.host == "krunker.io" and flow.request.path == "/":
            flow.response.set_text(self.header + self.game + self.footer)

addons = [
    Replacer()
]
#+END_SRC

Now, in addition to stringing together our three files, we're also reading in
'krunker.wasm', the binary version of the base64 blob, encoding it to base64,
and splicing it to the script where I'd substituted the original base64 blob
with "[REPLACE ME]".

Running =strings= on the wasm file reveals a couple of things. First, this part of
the game is written in Rust.

#+BEGIN_SRC prog

#+END_SRC

And, second, we're going to be met with some resistance.

#+END_SRC

I cracked open the Firefox debugger and found that the game wasn't spending a
lot of time in the WebAssembly component. Instead, there was a pseudo-file
called "SOURCE" that I could find no reference to. My first hypothesis was that
the code was zipped, so I tried stubbing out the methods of 'zip.js'.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
r.zip = {
  Reader: function () {
    console.log("Reader")
  },
  Writer: function () {
    console.log("Writer")
  },
  BlobReader: function () {
    console.log("BlobReade")
  },
  Data64URIReader: function () {
    console.log("Data64URIReader")
  },
  TextReader: function () {
    console.log("TextReader")
  },
  BlobWriter: function () {
    console.log("BlobWriter")
  },
  Data64URIWriter: function () {
    console.log("Data64URIWriter")
  },
  TextWriter: function () {
    console.log("TextWriter")
  },
  createReader: function () {
    console.log("createReader")
  },
  createWriter: function () {
    console.log("createWriter")
  },
}
#+END_SRC

But the game loaded fine. So I went back to the debugger and placed some
breakpoints around where the WebAssembly module is loaded, realizing that its
only purpose is to deobfuscate the JavaScript that eventually makes it into that
"SOURCE" pseudo-file I saw earlier. I figured this out by hooking the
=getStringFromWasm= function in 'game.js' and looking for any sort of JavaScript
code. I extracted these to files so I could beautify and inspect them. The
contents of "SOURCE" were in the second of these.

My first idea was to get rid of the WebAssembly and just inject the loaded
JavaScript instead. 

#+BEGIN_SRC python
with open("game.js") as f, open("krunker.wasm", "rb") as g, open("extracted.2.js") as h:
    # self.game = f.read().replace("[REPLACE ME]", b64encode(g.read()).decode())
    self.game = h.read()
#+END_SRC

But this breaks the game horribly. Inspecting the call stack in the debugger, I
found that the code in "SOURCE" is referenced twice. The second time being from
=__wbg_newwithargs_10def9c4239ab893=, which looks like

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
imports.wbg.__wbg_newwithargs_10def9c4239ab893 = function (A, g, Q, B) {
  return addHeapObject(new Function(getStringFromWasm(A, g), getStringFromWasm(Q, B)))
},
#+END_SRC

I thought that the code might have been injected by an =eval= or by adding a
=script= element to the document, but here it's using JavaScript's =Function=
constructor -- a feature I had no idea existed.

In my initial attempt to get a hold of the code, I encoded my extracted version
of "SOURCE" as base64, introduced a string called =replacement_code=, and replaced
the implementation of =__wbg_newwithargs_10def9c4239ab893= with this:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
// return addHeapObject(new Function(getStringFromWasm(A, g), getStringFromWasm(Q, B)))
return addHeapObject(new Function(getStringFromWasm(A, g), atob(replacement_code)));
#+END_SRC

This didn't work. So I added in some debug prints and realized that the function
wasn't being called with the same arguments every time (which should be
unsurprising).

Here was my second attempt:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
if (getStringFromWasm(Q, B).startsWith("!")) {
  console.log("Injecting code...")
  return addHeapObject(new Function(getStringFromWasm(A, g), atob(replacement_code)));
}
return addHeapObject(new Function(getStringFromWasm(A, g), getStringFromWasm(Q, B)));
#+END_SRC

This didn't work either. If we run the game twice and inspect the value of
=getStringFromWasm(A, g)= (the argument list), it clearly isn't the same both
times. So I decided to see if the function code was different, too.

#+BEGIN_SRC prog
jakob@Epsilon ~/ $ radiff2 -c {1,2}.js
File size differs 2462470 vs 2461765
Buffer truncated to 2461765 byte(s) (705 not compared)
86611
#+END_SRC

So... the WebAssembly is essentially generating JavaScript on-the-fly. Of
course, all renditions of the code do the same thing, but the variable names are
changing. My first thought was to stub out all of the nondeterministic imports
like =__wbg_random_09364f2d8647f133=, but this just broke things. Attempt three
was to see if I could add something to the function code and have it still work.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
return addHeapObject(new Function(getStringFromWasm(A, g), getStringFromWasm(Q, B) + " console.log('hello, world!'"));
#+END_SRC

The game didn't load this time, either. Strange, but then I remembered the
rather hostile strings in 'krunker.wasm' and decided to see what was happening
in the debugger. I hooked =__wbg_newwithargs_10def9c4239ab893= so that when the
=Function= object is created, that reference is saved to a global called
=the_function=. Then, I hooked =getObject=, the JavaScript glue for getting
something from the heap from WebAssembly, and if the object being returned is
=the_function=, I trip a breakpoint. The first time the function is referred to is
in =__wbg_toString_c663742ecc5b25ea=. If we've tampered with it, it goes straight
to =__wbindgen_object_drop_ref=. Otherwise, it goes to =__wbg_call_04d7c0ad06df27c9=
before being freed. So it seems the WebAssembly module is doing some sort of
tampering checking, checking the source code of the resultant =Function= to ensure
that we haven't hooked the =Function= constructor or anything like that. This is
actually pretty easy to get around. We could

1. Hook =__wbg_toString_c663742ecc5b25ea= to return a fake value when it's trying
   to get the source code of the =Function=.
2. Hook =__wbg_call_04d7c0ad06df27c9= and pull an [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC1ikwQ5Zgc][Indiana Jones]], calling a
   different function.

I went with the latter. To summarize the game plan, we'll hook the place where
the =Function= is constructed, get a reference to that =Function= object, hook the
place where it's called, and if it's the same reference we got before, call a
=Function= object of our own creation instead. Here's what my patch looks like:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
imports.wbg.__wbg_newwithargs_10def9c4239ab893 = function (A, g, Q, B) {
  if (getStringFromWasm(Q, B).startsWith("!")) {
    console.log("[PATCH] Got reference to game code function!");
    console.log("[PATCH] Code path: __wbg_newwithargs_10def9c4239ab893")
    the_function = new Function(getStringFromWasm(A, g), getStringFromWasm(Q, B));
    my_function = new Function(getStringFromWasm(A, g), "console.log('Successfully hooked!');" + getStringFromWasm(Q, B));
    return addHeapObject(the_function);
  }
  return addHeapObject(new Function(getStringFromWasm(A, g), getStringFromWasm(Q, B)))
},
...
imports.wbg.__wbg_call_04d7c0ad06df27c9 = function (A, g, Q, B, I) {
  try {
    const target = getObject(A);
    if (target === the_function) {
      console.log("[PATCH] Preparing to Indiana Jones that shit...")
      return addHeapObject(my_function
                           .call(getObject(g), getObject(Q), getObject(B), getObject(I)))
    }
    return addHeapObject(getObject(A)
                         .call(getObject(g), getObject(Q), getObject(B), getObject(I)))
  } catch (A) {
    handleError(A)
  }
},

This time, our modification of the code worked. Nice! With that, we can address
one quality-of-life issue that was starting to get on my nerves.

# Footnote: I'd like to experiment with parsing it into an AST and walking that.

Because the names of references are generated at runtime, we can't really just
substitute in our own code string. We have to modify the string that's generated
by the WebAssembly module. We'll have to find something worth changing before we
can do that, though, so I began to read through the generated source code. The
first thing that stood out to me was an array of weapon definitions. Here's how

  'rumbleDur': 0x1f4,
  'icnPad': 0x9
}
#+END_SRC

Some parts of it are obfuscated,[fn:4] but some aren't. My first attempt at a
cheat was to set all of the =recoil= and =spread= values to zero.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
code = code.replace(/('recoil\w*?':)[0-9\x\. ]*?,/g, function(match, p1, offset, string) {
  console.log(match);
  return p1 + "0.000,";
});
code = code.replace(/('spread':)[0-9\x\. ]*?,/g, function(match, p1, offset, string) {
  console.log(match);
  return p1 + "0x0,";
});
#+END_SRC

This seemed to work until I actually tried shooting people and realized that my
bullets weren't hitting anything, which made me suspect that the server was
responsible for taking the spread into account.

I also came across the definitions for the game's "classes".

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
{
  'name': 'Triggerman',
  'loadout': [0x1],
  'secondary': !0x0,
  'colors': [0xa77860, 0x3d3d3d, 0x232323, 0x282828, 0x6c5042, 0xbfbfbf],
  'health': 0x64,
  'segs': 0x6,
  'speed': 1.05
}
#+END_SRC

So I tried setting =speed= to something absurdly high, but after a few seconds of
moving forward I'd be teleported back. Again, it seems the server is also
calculating my movement and realizing that something's wrong.

Rather than find which values are truly client-side and which are verified
server-side, I decided to implement the bread and butter of client-side cheats:
a wallhack. My thinking was that the easy way to go about this would be to patch
every call to =gl.depthFunc= and set the =func= parameter to =gl.ALWAYS=.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
code = code.replace(/\['depthFunc'\]\(0x\d\d\d\)/g, function(match, p1, offset, string) {
  return "['depthFunc'](0x207)";
});
#+END_SRC

This actually worked, but not in a way that's helpful for getting an advantage
in the game. So I had to be a bit more clever. Looking through 'extracted.2.js',
it's pretty obvious that they're using [[https://threejs.org/][three.js]], and from experience, I know
that when it comes to rendering something 2D over a three.js scene, most people
opt for some sort of overlay. So I did a search for 'game-overlay', and found
that it occurs only once.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript

Not the most readable snippet, but there are a few things that stand out to me.
Namely, iterating over the =players= list and rendering something using the =health=
attribute. Those four =if= statements seem to be checking if the player is visible
(given away by the =czQ['frustum']['containsPoint'](cAI)=), so what if we just
patch out the =continue='s?

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
code = code.replace(/if\(\!\(czW=czP\['players'].*cAI\)\)\)continue;/, function(match, p1, offset, string) {
  return "try{" + match.replace(/continue/g, "true") + "}catch(e){continue;}";
});

I pulled a professional programmer move and wrapped everything in a =try=, =catch=
block because the game would freeze up without it, but this works pretty well.

And, hey! We have a wallhack! This probably isn't representative of /all/ browser
games -- I'd expect most to be easier to screw with -- but I thought that the
obfuscation and anti-cheat measures here made for a worthy opponent. It doesn't
stack up against [[https://vmcall.blog/battleye-stack-walking/][BattlEye]], but this did take me more than an afternoon to figure
out. To that effect, nice work, Sidney!

I'm inevitably going to get flack for cheating in a video game. Before you write
me an email, understand that I really don't care. I have a lot more fun reverse
engineering games and writing cheats for them than I do playing them. If it
makes you feel any better, the only time these cheats see any use is when I'm
demonstrating them. Peace out.

[fn:1] I didn't notice the request for '/textures/recticle.png' until I was editing this. Sheesh, that's an unfortunate typo.
[fn:2] Given that the author is a self-proclaimed "JavaScript and NodeJS developer", I'm not particularly surprised by the embarrassingly childish name. Go ahead, bud. Put that on your CV.
[fn:4] Identifiers like ='VuFlFKJOHFGfinUeccOKbaQQPyhjvfYD'= are pretty common in the code. I suspect these are the high-stakes variables that people like me would be grepping for.
